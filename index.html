            A mobile phone, also known as a cellphone or simply a mobile, is a portable electronic device that allows users to make calls, send text messages, and access the internet wirelessly. Mobile phones are powered by rechargeable batteries and communicate with cellular networks to provide voice and data services.

The first mobile phones were introduced in the 1980s and were large and expensive, but since then, they have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful. Today, most mobile phones are smartphones, which combine the features of a phone with those of a computer, including internet access, email, social media, and a wide range of apps.

        <p>
            A PC, or personal computer, is a general-purpose computer designed for individual use. Unlike mainframe computers or servers, which are designed to handle large amounts of data and perform complex tasks for many users, a PC is typically used by one person to perform a range of tasks, from basic word processing and browsing the internet to advanced gaming and video editing.

            A typical PC consists of a desktop or laptop computer with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The computer itself contains a processor, memory, storage, and various input/output ports, which allow users to connect to peripherals such as printers, cameras, and external storage devices.

        <h3>Tablet</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        A tablet, often referred to as a "tab," is a mobile computing device that typically features a touchscreen display, portable form factor, and long battery life. Tablets are often used as a lightweight alternative to laptops and desktop computers, and are particularly popular for their convenience, portability, and ease of use.

Tablets are typically powered by a mobile operating system, such as Android or iOS, and offer a range of features such as internet browsing, email, video and music playback, and access to a variety of apps through app stores. Many tablets also include cameras, microphones, and other features that make them suitable for video calls, social media, and content creation.
